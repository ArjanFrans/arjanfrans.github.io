### Super Mario Bros. clone
*August 2013*

My first attempt at making a somewhat playable game.
It is written in Java using the [LibGdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) engine.

### 2D Maze Game
*October 2014*

A year after I wrote my first game, I wrote this in my spare time. I never really finished (maybe I will finish it someday), but it is playble. I challenged myself to give the code a much better structure, by carefully thinking about every class or method I created. It is also written in Java, using [LibGdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
